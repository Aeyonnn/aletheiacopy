2,Biden Administration Considering Pivot To Good Presidency,"Signaling a potential change in strategy after a tumultuous first year, Biden administration officials confirmed Monday they were considering a pivot to a good presidency. “While we’re confident that the nation needed flailing, directionless leadership, we are starting to realize that what Americans want is a president who is good at his job and not bad at his job,” said press secretary Jen Psaki, who also relayed concern from Democratic insiders that it was an extremely risky move to try and be successful and popular instead of being despised, inept failures. “We’ve been focused on underperforming expectations and backtracking on key campaign promises, but now we’re thinking of changing course and concentrating on becoming effective for a while. There are some concerns from advisors that a transition to high approval ratings and strong support from the American people goes against the normal Democratic brand, but we think it might be worth a chance.” At press time, sources reported the administration had decided to back down from pivoting to a good presidency due to growing anxiety about the spending that would entail.",Monday 8:38AM,https://www.theonion.com/biden-meets-with-senate-democrats-to-discuss-breaking-u-1848434601
3,Biden Meets With Senate Democrats To Discuss Breaking Up Supreme Court Nominee And Confirming Her In Parts,"In a closed-door meeting to discuss strategies to fill the recently vacated court seat, President Biden reportedly met with Senate Democrats Thursday to discuss breaking up his Supreme Court nominee and confirming her in parts. “Many moderate members of the caucus fear that we’re inviting backlash by trying to push through the entire justice’s body at once, and we’d be far better served with a piecemeal method of getting her limbs and vital organs onto the court one by one,” said a moderate senator familiar with the discussions, adding that given the procedural hurdles in their way, the best chance Democrats had at filling Justice Breyer’s former seat involved voting for one of the justice’s shoulders and then perhaps a lung or two. “We already have a lot of agreement within the caucus that one of her hands would logically be approved immediately—so that it can hold a gavel, obviously. Moving on from there, getting to her torso would be a cherry on top. If we’re ambitious, we might actually get through her entire circulatory system. That’d be a huge win for progressives and moderates alike. But let’s cross that bridge when we get to it.” Senate moderates also pointed out the precedent of Republicans putting Justice Sandra Day O’Connor’s floating head onto the Supreme Court in 1981.",1/27/22 1:15PM,https://www.theonion.com/biden-vows-that-if-russia-invades-ukraine-u-s-will-in-1848401421
4,"Biden Vows That If Russia Invades Ukraine, U.S. Will Invade One Country Of Equivalent Value","Condemning Putin’s actions across the region in the strongest possible terms, President Joe Biden vowed Monday that if Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States would invade one country of equivalent value. “Should Russia attempt any incursion on Ukraine, the U.S. will not stand down, and we will have no choice but to use our full military force to invade a different yet similar nation,” said Biden, adding that the U.S. had already investigated several targets with equivalent GDPs, populations, and landmasses to potentially invade should Russia continue it’s unsanctioned war. “America has troops positioned all over the world, and should Putin continue his bullying, I will deploy them against one, or even several small countries, that Russia has zero interest in, but are still valuable when you add them all up together. Putin—you’ve been warned. “ At press time, U.S. troops were stationed along the borders of 17 different countries and awaiting further instructions.",1/24/22 7:00AM,https://www.theonion.com/nancy-pelosi-introduces-landmark-legislation-to-provide-1848393259
5,Nancy Pelosi Introduces Landmark Legislation To Provide Aid For Struggling Personal Stock Portfolio,"In an effort to revive her lagging capital gains, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced a landmark piece of legislation Thursday that would appropriate federal funds to provide aid for her struggling personal stock portfolio. “This monumental bill will inject a much-needed and long-overdue stimulus, allowing my individual stock picks to reach their full potential,” said Pelosi, who remarked that America had to invest big in her private brokerage account now to ensure her frequent buying and selling of shares outperformed the market in the long term. “Without this measure, my equity investments will continue to be trapped in a cycle of disappointing compound annual growth rates. Being able to maximize the rate of return on my holdings is core to the American promise, and this bill delivers on that promise.” A press release issued by Pelosi’s office touted more than 30 of the speaker’s stock positions that would be lifted out of the red if the legislation were adopted.",1/20/22 2:20PM,https://www.theonion.com/poll-average-u-s-horse-still-prefers-carrot-to-photo-1848363244
6,Poll: Average U.S. Horse Still Prefers Carrot To Photo Of Biden,"In the latest indicator of the commander in chief’s waning popularity, a new Rasmussen poll released Monday showed that the average U.S. horse still overwhelmingly preferred a carrot to a photo of President Joe Biden. “A staggering 98 percent of American horses responded more enthusiastically to the carrot than it did to an 4-by-6 glossy of Biden,” said poll analyst Morgan Fellers, noting that within that group, almost half of the participants went so far as to huff and stomp their feet when the carrot was taken away and replaced with the two-dimensional rendering of the president. “According to these results, one in 25 U.S. horses became spooked by the very mention of Biden and ran stampeding out of their stables—that alone should set off alarm bells throughout the DNC. It’s also important to note that the president will not be able to coast on the popularity of his running mate, either, should he mount a reelection campaign: More than 60 percent of horses completely rebuffed a photo of Kamala Harris when presented with an apple core.” At press time, Biden’s favorability had reportedly skyrocketed after pollsters began burying his photo in a stack of sugar cubes.",1/17/22 10:05AM,https://www.theonion.com/congress-preparing-for-another-january-6-by-enrolling-i-1848309869
7,Congress Preparing For Another January 6 By Enrolling In Group Karate Class,"Nervously fiddling with their new white belts as they waited for their instructor in the training hall, U.S. Congress members reportedly prepared for another Jan. 6 on Thursday by participating in a group class at the D.C.-area True Method Karate Studio. “We simply cannot allow what happened last year to ever repeat itself, which is why from now on we’ll be meeting up once a week to study the martial art of karate with Howard-sensei,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who stood barefoot on the dōjō mat among his fellow lawmakers, practicing making a seiken proper fist before moving through a variety of basic stances. “After last Jan. 6, we just felt so powerless and humiliated. This will be a great way to not only gain back our confidence, but be ready to defend ourselves with kicks, punches, and blocks in the event there’s ever another insurrection. Plus, it’s a whole lot of fun!” At press time, sources confirmed the class was seething with envy after Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-CO) became the first to receive his yellow belt.",1/06/22 3:56PM,https://www.theonion.com/biden-vows-not-to-forget-lessons-of-january-6-we-must-1848314924
8,Biden Vows Not To Forget Lessons Of January 6: ‘We Must Hang Mike Pence’,"In a stirring speech at the U.S. Capitol Thursday morning, President Joe Biden vowed not to forget the lessons of the Jan. 6 riot, urging Americans to hang former Vice President Mike Pence. “We stand here today to declare that we will not back down in the face of tyranny, and we will gut the traitor Pence limb from limb for the way he turned on President Trump,” said Biden, who spent nearly 10 minutes of his prepared remarks encouraging the crowd to chant “Hang Mike Pence! Hang Mike Pence!” along with him. “What can we learn from the events of Jan. 6? The enduring lesson here is that we must drag Mike Pence from his home and string him up from the rafters for all to see. Where was he when his president needed him most? Where was he when the true patriots needed his help to stop the steal? The only way to heal this divided nation is to unite around the shared cause of killing Mike Pence for his many failures as vice president. God bless this country, and God bless you all.” Biden was then seen departing the Capitol with a pistol, vowing to take revenge on Mike Pence himself.",1/06/22 1:56PM,https://www.theonion.com/u-s-democracy-under-siege-after-tech-lobbyist-invites-1848302748
9,U.S. Democracy Under Siege After Tech Lobbyist Invites Some Senators To Dinner,"In what both ordinary citizens and experts agreed was a threat to the nation’s political system, American democracy reportedly came under siege Thursday after a tech lobbyist invited some senators to dinner. “Rarely do we see such a brazen attack on our democratic values, and yet we could only watch in shock and horror as a paid representative for several biotech firms entered Charlie Palmer Steak with three U.S. senators for a sumptuous five-course meal,” said political scientist Monica Turley, adding that the vicious assault on representative self-government was compounded by the fact that U.S. intelligence officials had done nothing to address it, despite records showing that the dinner reservation had been in place for months. “Only in a country where democracy is in real danger could we see the lobbyist for a private interest discussing wine pairings with sitting members of Congress. What’s even more frightening is how shameless this attempt on our democracy was: Any passerby could have seen these individuals openly plotting how they would split up the seared foie gras and heirloom tomato salad. Ultimately, we may look back at the dinner of Jan. 6, 2022, as the beginning of the complete breakdown of the contract between the government and its people.” Political experts were at a loss for how to address this blatant threat to democracy, adding that virtually no one in any U.S. government institution seemed capable of doing anything to prevent the group from ordering dessert.",1/06/22 8:05AM,https://www.theonion.com/critics-warn-biden-s-plan-to-remove-lead-pipes-would-pu-1848228810
10,Critics Warn Biden’s Plan To Remove Lead Pipes Would Put Millions Of Potential Murder Weapons In Circulation,"Denouncing the Biden administration’s plan to replace every lead pipe in the nation’s water systems, critics warned Thursday that such an initiative would put millions of potential murder weapons into circulation across American cities. “The president is proposing a dangerous new government program that would place deadly weapons in the hands of violent criminals,” said Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), adding that while the reduction of drinking water toxicity was a noble goal on paper, once the estimated 6 to 10 million pipes were no longer in use as mains and service lines, the increased availability of metal bludgeons would push homicide rates to record highs. “It’s completely reckless and irresponsible to be giving out free murder weapons in the name of environmental safety. What good is safe drinking water if American families can’t walk down the street without getting their heads bashed in by a pipe-wielding thug? Lead pipes must remain safely below the ground.” Cotton later clarified that he still supported the constitutional right of law-abiding citizens to carry lead pipes in public and beat people to death in self-defense.",12/16/21 3:00PM,https://www.theonion.com/political-analysts-say-gop-could-take-house-if-a-few-ke-1848196631
11,Political Analysts Say GOP Could Take House If A Few Key Assassinations Break Their Way,"Noting the razor-thin leads that could be overcome with a minimal amount of bloodshed, pundits confirmed Tuesday that all the GOP needed to take the House of Representatives in 2022 was for a few key assassinations to break their way. “We’re seeing a number of races across the country with vulnerable Democratic incumbents who could be taken down with nothing more than a standard rifle,” said Meet The Press host Chuck Todd, confirming that Republicans could feel optimistic about delivering the House to Kevin McCarthy if they could just eke out a few gun-toting psychopaths in purple districts. “There’s a lot of anger at President Biden’s agenda right now, and if Republicans are canny, they can exploit that by funding local members on the ground who can translate cash into murdering their political opponents.” Todd cautioned that if Democrats weren’t careful, being sprayed by a volley of bullets could lead to significant disarray within the party.",12/14/21 7:00AM,https://www.theonion.com/gop-warns-loophole-in-new-bill-could-still-allow-teache-1848195307
12,GOP Warns Loophole In New Bill Could Still Allow Teachers To Sing About Critical Race Theory,"Alarmed by what they called “a major oversight,” Wisconsin Republicans warned Tuesday that a loophole in a new bill could still allow teachers to sing about critical race theory. “Though the current version of Senate Bill 411 explicitly bars teachers from talking about critical race theory in the classroom, it has been called to my attention that there is not a single clause preventing teachers from indoctrinating our children through original ballads, anthems, or soulful little ditties,” said Wisconsin State Assembly speaker Robin Vos, who urged legislators in the state Senate to take immediate action to amend the bill, lest teachers start dividing students up by soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. “No child should be made to feel guilty about the color of their skin by a teacher singing a Swedish pop song about reparations. They’ll give the Black children the melody and stick the white children with the harmony. The next thing you know they’ll be adding dance moves, and then there’s no coming back—our children are gone.” At press time, Vos also warned the loophole would allow for schools to teach critical race theory through painting, Play-Doh, and crafting paper mobiles.",12/14/21 7:00AM,https://www.theonion.com/and-what-do-you-want-me-to-do-brush-every-night-sna-1848187662
