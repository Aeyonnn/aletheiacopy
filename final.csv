1,FGen 'cover cost' cuts Meralco rates  in Feb.,  'The earlier-anticipated hike in the electricity rate of Manila Electric Company (Meralco) was overturned resulting in overall reduction of P0.1185 per kilowatt hour (kWh) in the February billing cycle due to the “cover cost” or compensation generated by power supplier First Gen Corporation (FGen).'   'The “cover cost” was a result from the “gas restriction” FGen suffered last year in its gas sale and purchase agreement (GSPA) with Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. (SPEX) the operator of the Malampaya gas field.'  'Meralco Vice President Lawrence S. Fernandez explained that First Gas “received cover cost from SPEX for the gas restriction from prior months and the amount was large enough to offset the increase in Malampaya price.”'   'As a result the all-inclusive tariff of Meralco this February billing would then be pared down to P9.5842 per kWh from the January pass-on rate of P9.7027 per kWh according to the utility firm.'  'Fernandez said the “cover cost” accounts for “compensation when there is supply restriction from Malampaya and that accrued from prior months and it’s just reflected this month.”'   'For Meralco customers in the 200-kWh consumption bracket the aggregate reduction in their electric bills this month will amount to P24 and P35 cut for those in the 300-kWh usage band.'  'The power firm’s generation charge for the month had been down by P0.2305 per kWh to P5.1957 per kWh from the previous billing cycle’s P5.4262 per kWh; with it emphasizing that the ‘compensation cost’ for First Gen had cushioned the increase from its gas-repricing for the period.'   '“The IPP (independent power producer) charges reflected a reimbursement from SPEX to First Gas covering a portion of incremental fuel cost incurred in relation to the use of liquid fuel during unplanned Malampaya gas supply restrictions” Meralco expounded.'  'It reiterated that the cost reimbursement to First Gen “were able to more than offset the increase in Malampaya natural gas prices resulting from its quarterly repricing; and an increase in coal prices.”'  'The gas plants of First Gen under contract with Meralco are the 1000MW Santa Rita; 500MW San Lorenzo and 414MW San Gabriel plants – and these have been the generating facilities affected by Malampaya field’s gas restriction dilemma.'  'For the other cost components the ancillary services charge pass-on of system operator of National Grid Corporation of the Philippines had increased by P0.0454 per kWh; while taxes and other charges had likewise been higher by P0.0666 per kWh.'         ,"Published February 8, 2022, 2:55 PM",https://mb.com.ph/2022/02/08/fgen-cover-cost-cuts-meralco-rates-in-feb-billing/
2,"BSP shifts to more frequent, detailed 'forward guidance'",  'Instead of the quarterly inflation report the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) will shift to providing a new Monetary Policy Report (MPR) starting next week to ensure a clearer detailed and more frequent signalling of its monetary policy stance.'   'The BSP said on Tuesday Feb. 8 that the structure and contents of the MPR “will reflect the emphasis on the BSP’s views and outlook for inflation and growth and when necessary provide forward guidance.”'  'Forward guidance is a tool used by the BSP and other central banks to convey or telegraph future monetary policy stance and direction for the guidance of the markets businesses and consumers.' 'The difference between the MPR and the inflation quarterly report – while both under the BSP’s Inflation Targeting Framework — is that the MPR will have more transparency and increased disclosure and communication by the BSP of its policy decisions said the central bank.'  '“The MPR will continue to convey to the public the overall thinking behind the BSP’s decisions on monetary policy. However a greater part of the report will be devoted to the forward-looking discussions on inflation and the key macroeconomic variables that affect inflation as well as the risks and uncertainty surrounding the BSP’s inflation forecasts” said the BSP.' 'The BSP will conduct briefings for the media and market analysts to discuss the key highlights of the MPR next week after the announcement of the Monetary Board policy decision on Feb. 17. The MPR briefing is the next day Feb. 18.' 'There will be MPR press briefings as well in May August and November. The Monetary Board will have eight policy meetings this year the first is on Feb. 17. The May 19 policy meeting is the third policy meeting for the year. The one in August or Aug. 18 is the fifth policy meeting while the Nov. 17 schedule is the Monetary Board’s seventh policy meeting for 2022.'  '“The MPR will then be available to the public the following day” said the BSP refering to each monetary policy decision announcement.' 'The BSP said the MPR will be published four times in a given year and it will “correspond with the availability of major economic data releases such as the quarterly national income accounts.”' '“The MPR will serve as the flagship BSP publication on monetary policy to provide the public a detailed view of the BSP’s forecasts as well as the guidance on the likely direction of monetary policy over the next two years. The shift to the MPR also aligns the BSP’s publication practices with those of other central banks that publish monetary policy reports following the announcement of monetary policy decisions” said the BSP.' 'In September last year BSP Governor Benjamin E. Diokno said the BSP will use all types of forward guidance to help calm markets by providing a credible and clear direction of monetary policy especially as conditions change with the eventual normalization of US and European interest rates.' 'The BSP’s Monetary Board has been known to give “purely qualitative forward guidance” which are “broad statements that give an overview of the likely future path of monetary policy” such as when they say – as the BSP often does – that it remains “keen on sustaining monetary policy support for as long as necessary in order for the momentum of economic recovery to gain more traction as well as to help boost domestic demand and market confidence especially as risk aversion continues to temper credit activity.”'  'The most common BSP forward guidance is when they say the central bank “stands ready to adjust its policy settings as needed to ensure price and financial stability conducive to a sustainable economic recovery.” As such the benchmark interest rate which is the overnight reverse repurchase facility (RRP) has remained steady at the record low of two percent since November 2020.' 'Diokno said last year that the Monetary Board is not just about making broad statements. He stressed that the BSP would also subtly use the other two types of forward guidance applied by the US Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank which are state-contigent or time-contigent forward guidance.' 'Unlike the purely qualitative forward guidance foreign central banks would often use state-contingent forward guidance which has specific conditions that should happen before any monetary policy action will take place such as when the inflation rate hits a certain level.' ,"Published February 8, 2022, 4:45 PM",https://mb.com.ph/2022/02/08/bsp-shifts-to-more-frequent-detailed-forward-guidance/

LEYCO' 'Government collection of duties from imported rice jumped 22 percent to P18.9 billion in 2021 but it incurred foregone revenues on pork tariff cuts the Department of Finance (DOF) said.'   'Citing reports from the Bureau of Customs the DOF reported Tuesday Feb. 8 that the government generated P18.9 billion in duties from rice imports from January to December last year higher by 22 percent than the P15.5 billion in the previous year.'  'Customs Commissioner Rey Leonardo Guerrero reported to the DOF that P10 billion of the import duties collected from rice will go to the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund (RCEF) as provided under Republic Act (RA) No. 11203 or the Rice Tariffication Law (RTL).'   'The RCEF is used to finance programs that aims to sharpen the competitiveness of palay growers by way of providing them easy access to fertilizer farm machinery and equipment high-yield seeds and cheap credit.'   'Last October Guerrero said the Customs was able to collect additional rice duties after the agency gave “particular attention” to the classification quantity and weight of the imports whenever rice shipments came in.'  'Guerrero said that for January to October 15 2021 alone the average valuation of rice increased by 6.5 percent or P1240 per metric ton.'  'Meanwhile Guerrero said the Customs incurred an estimated P4 billion in foregone revenue due to President Duterte’s executive orders that lowered pork import tariffs and increased the allowable import volumes of the meat.'   'These directives were meant to quell inflation by boosting the supply of pork and stabilizing its retail prices in the domestic market after the outbreak of the Asian Swine Fever (ASF) had hurt domestic hog production.'  'Between April 9 2021 to January 28 2022 the bureau collected only P3.75 billion from a total volume of 242 million kilograms of imported pork.'
