1,Gilas gets free ride to 2nd round of FIBA World Cup Asian Qualifiers,"South Korea has been officially disqualified from contention, giving free passes to Gilas Pilipinas and the rest of the Group A through to the second round of the 2023 FIBA World Cup Asian Qualifiers.
FIBA over the weekend announced the first set of qualified teams into the next phase without South Korea due to disqualification after its last-minute withdrawal for the games held last February 24 to 28 at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.
South Korea was in Group A along with the Philippines, New Zealand and India, which have gained automatic tickets to the next stage though they have still remaining matches in the first round.
Gilas, as lead host, is already in the World Cup but is still participating in the qualifiers as part of its long preparation.
With the disqualification, South Korea in the process will miss the World Cup for only the first time since the 2010 edition in Turkey.
Gilas was supposed to play South Korea twice in the just-concluded window before the latter's pullout after being ravaged by COVID-19 cases in their camp.
Without its good rival, Gilas went on to split its campaign with a win against India, 88-64, and loss to unbeaten New Zealand, 88-63.
India, of all Group A squads, benefitted the most from South Korea's abrupt exit with a free lane to the second round despite a winless 0-3 card so far.
Australia and Japan of Group B, Jordan and Lebanon of Group C, Kazakhstan and Iran of Group D were the other qualified teams so far in the second round with still a window left in the first stage.
Six World Cup tickets are at stake in the qualifiers with Japan also securing an automatic berth as co-host. Other host Indonesia has to finish in the Top 8 of the FIBA Asia Cup in July to get in."

And with a monster double-double of 21 points and 21 rebounds in his first game for Phoenix, it seems that Phoenix has finally found the missing piece for the conference.
""He brought so much energy to us. I think what he brought to us was solid defense on the paint, he's making smart moves defensively down the stretch. He was [also] making his shots,"" raved Phoenix head coach Topex Robinson.
""But most importantly, I think the energy he brings to the team is really important,"" he added.
Maxwell replaced Dominique Sutton, who was given the boot by the Fuel Masters after four games where Phoenix found themselves in a three-game losing streak.
Now, after helping Phoenix get back into the playoff conversation, Robinson believes they've finall found the right person to lead them to the quarterfinals and beyond.
""Especially on an import conference wherein you really have to have somebody that the locals will believe in and I think DeVaun was a really right fit for us,"" he said.
The Fuel Masters will play their final game in eliminations on Friday, March 11, against the Meralco Bolts."
3,Alyssa Valdez ecstatic for Philippine volleyball team return,"Volleyball royalty Alyssa Valdez is looking forward to her return to the national team, which will start training in Brazil next month in preparation for the Hanoi Southeast Asian Games slated May 12 to 23.
“I always say it’s really one of my dreams to represent our country and I’m excited to do anything for the team and the role that our coach will give me,” said Valdez during Saturday’s interview with Noli Eala at One PH’s Power and Play.
Valdez, a former national team skipper and SEA Games flag-bearer, is expected to be part of the 14-member national women’s squad the PNVF will submit to the Philippine Olympic Committee before the March 12 entry-by-name deadline in the biennial meet.
Initially, Valdez was not in the national team roster when the PNVF selected the players last year but made it to the squad in January this year after the college players who were originally in the pack were dropped due to conflict of schedule.
Valdez and the 13 other players who will be enlisted to Hanoi will join in the Brazil training slated April 12 to 26, or days after the Premier Volleyball League Open Conference ends.
Valdez and the all-pro squad will use their stints with their mother clubs in the PVL as part of their training for the SEA Games.
Kalei Mau, Jia Morado, Dawn Macandili, Dindin Manabat, Jasmin Nabor, Kianna Dy, Mylene Paat, Kat Tolentino, Deanna Wong, Kath Arado and Riri Meneses are among those tipped to make the team, assuming they are available."
4,Koreans wrest control as Saso flounders in HSBC Women's World Championship,"In Gee Chun flashed superb control of her hybrid shots as she came away with a bogey-free 66 to storm ahead of a stellar cast and lead a Korean assault the HSBC Women’s World Championship in Singapore Saturday.
With Jeongeun Lee6 shooting a 65 and erstwhile co-leader Jin Young Ko dropping to joint second with a 69 to stalk Chun by just one stroke, a Sunday thriller shapes up among the aces from the talent-rich nation.
But a mix of international aces, excluding Japanese Yuka Saso, are ready to pounce in, just three strokes behind, including Danielle Kang of the US, who carded a second 68 in three days, Thai Atthaya Thitikul, who turned in a 70, and Amy Yang, also of Korea, shot a 71, while Canadian Brooke Henderson also put in a 71 to stay into the thick of things despite falling four strokes off Chun heading to an expected scorching high noon duel at Sentosa’s Tanjong course Sunday.
But Chun shone in a day of changing fortunes when the leaders changed hands a number of times before the two-time major winner took command up with a pair of 33s and lined herself for a fourth LPGA diadem with a 12-under 204.
Lee6, the 2019 US Women’s Open champion, produced the tournament-best 65 spiked by an eagle on No. 13 and four straight birdies from No. 4 as she caught up with Ko at second at 205 after the world No. 1 snapped a par-game at the front with three birdies in the first five holes at the back, her 69 extending her rounds in the 60s to 14 straight dating back to the 2021 BMW Championship back at home last October.
But Kang, seeking a second victory in four LPGA events in the season, bounced back from a second round 71 with a 69 to pool a 207 in a tie with Thitikul, winner here in the Women’s Amateur Asia-Pacific crown 2018, who rebounded from a miscue on No. 4 with birdies on Nos. 8, 10 and 13, while Yang missed grabbing a share of second with a double bogey on No. 16.
But the four-time LPGA winner, who racked up all her victories in Southeast Asia, including three in Thailand, stayed in the hunt for another title run in the region.
Earlier, Saso, way behind at joint 43rd with 71-73 in the first two rounds, put herself out of play and contention with three bogeys in the first five holes at the back. Though she checked her skid with birdies on Nos. 18 and 1, the ICTSI-backed ace yielded the strokes on a double bogey mishap on No. 3.
Reeling near the tail-end of the select 65-player field, the reigning US Women’s Open champion birdied two of the last three to salvage a 35-38 for a share of 45th at 217.
That was 13 shots off Chun, who worked her way up from joint sixth with birdies on Nos. 1, 5 and 6 then sustained her charge to gain strokes on Nos. 10, 13 and 15 in a solid round she anchored on superb ball striking. She hit all but one fairway and missed just three greens while finishing with 27 putts.
Meanwhile, Thai Patty Tavatanakit, who took charge with a 67 Thursday but fell to tied 21st with a second round 74, came out of nowhere to grab a share of the lead at 9-under with a stirring six-under card after 13 holes. But the reigning ANA Inspiration champion played the last two par-3s at four-over before holing out on No. 18 with a bogey for the second straight day, sending her back to where she started – in the middle of the pack.
Her double bogeys on Nos. 15 and 17 and a last-hole mishap all but put to naught her brilliancy majority of the round, falling to a share of 22nd at 212, eight strokes off the leader."
5,Phoenix outgun Aces to boost PBA playoff bid,"The Phoenix Super LPG Fuel Masters revived their playoff hopes in the PBA Governors' Cup as they edged the Alaska Aces, 104-99, at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on Thursday.
With their post-season in peril, the Fuel Masters ended a three-game slide and fended off the Aces in a nip-and-tuck affair that saw both teams go on scoring runs to keep things interesting.
Phoenix's debuting import Du'vaughn Maxwell scored on a tough basket with 20 ticks left in the game to pad the Fuel Masters' lead to four, 103-99.
While Maxwell failed to convert on the bonus free throw, it proved enough as the Aces turned the ball over in the next possession that doomed their chances.
RJ Jazul then split at the free throw line to arrive at the final score.
Though Phoenix was ahead for most of the game, the Aces were always breathing down their necks with numerous scoring runs that kept the Fuel Masters sweating.
A 13-0 run for Alaska even had the Aces ahead, 93-92, with 5:32 ticks left in the game.
But a quick 7-1 burst flipped the script and had Phoenix ahead anew, 99-94.
The Fuel Masters improved to .500 with a 5-5 record to return to playoff contention.
Meanwhile, the Aces, who are in the midst of their farewell tour in the PBA, fell to 6-4.
Matthew Wright was the top scorer for Phoenix with 26 points. He also had 11 assists and seven rebounds.
Jason Perkins, who keyed a hot start for Phoenix, chipped in 22 points.
Maxwell and Jazul had 21 points each as well, with the former also having 21 rebounds for a monster double-double.
For the Aces, it was Ashaolu who took charge with 24 points."
6,"Kiefer Ravena, Shiga fall short of upset bid against Ryukyu","Kiefer Ravena and the Shiga Lakestars could not shake off their losing slump as they were stymied in trying to upset the Ryukyu Golden Kings, 98-84, in the Japan B. League at the Ukaru-chan Arena on Saturday.
After Ravena hit a triple to tie the game for Shiga in the middle of the third quarter, 46-all, Ryukyu ramped up their offense and scored 30 points in the final seven minutes of the period.
This led to a twin-digit cushion, 76-62, against the Lakestars heading into the final salvo.
That scoring outburst proved to be the fatal blow for Shiga, which failed to recover as they saw the Golden Kings balloon their lead to as big as 24 points in the final period.
Shiga thus absorbed their third loss in a row.
But the productive offense continues for Ravena as he finished with 17 points, nine assists, three rebounds and two steals in the loss.
Elsewhere, Kobe Paras and the Niigata Albirex BB absorbed their 30th loss of the season as they fell to the Akita Northern Happinets, 92-76.
After playing at pace with Akita in the first salvo, Niigata lost steam as they were clobbered -- especially in the third salvo where Akita's lead increased to as big as 21 points.
Paras, though, came out with a decent performance as he finished with 12 points, four rebounds, three assists and a block in the losing effort.
In B2, Kemark Carino went scoreless in 12 minutes off of the bench in the Aomori Wat's 69-85 loss to the Ehime Orange Vikings."
7,"Fernandez passes Chinese foe's test, enters Monterrey Open semis","Forget the Leylah Fernandez-Elina Svitolina rematch, but brace for tough, thrilling clashes down the stretch of the Abierto GNP Seguros 2022 in Monterrey, Mexico.
The second-ranked Fernandez bundled out a second Chinese rival to remain on course of her title-retention drive bolstered by the shock exit of the top-seeded Svitolina in the quarterfinals early Saturday.
The US Women’s Open finalist, 19, leaned on her power serve to blast unfancied Qiang Wang in the 10th game of the second set after surviving a scary opening set grind that took a tiebreaker to finish for a 7-6(4), 6-4 triumph at the Club Sonoma’s hard court.
Fernandez broke her 30-year-old rival in the fifth game of the second set to wrest a 3-2 lead then after trading serves, she quickly produced four straight points on her power hits in the 10th game that Wang had failed to control and return, leading to the 1:47-minute romp.
The victory came on heels of her big escape over Qinwen Zheng, 6-1, 4-6, 7-6(3), in the Round of 16 Wednesday with the long respite giving her a lot of energy and fire against Wang, who dragged her into a protracted battle in the opening set.
The duo slugged it out in a tight, fierce duel, trading breaks midway and holding to end up tied at 6. But the Fil-Canadian broke her rival to wrest a 4-3 lead in the tiebreak, scored on a service winner on the next then slammed one in off Wang’s lob return.
Fernandez kept Wang in the game with a faulty backhand return that slammed into the net but hit a big return after a brief rally in the ensuing play to clinch the hard-earned set.
“I feel great, really, ready for the next match,” said Fernandez, referring to her semis clash with Brazilian Beatriz Haddad Maia late Saturday.
“I’ll sleep, get ready for another match and put on another good show,” added the world No. 21, who beat Swiss qualifier Viktorija Golubic, 6-1, 6-3, here last year to nail her first WTA championship without dropping a set.
She overpowered Slovak Anna Schmiediova, 6-2, 6-2, in the first round of the 32-player main draw.
Maia, meanwhile, saved three match points and wore down hard-luck Czech Marie Bouzkova in the tiebreak to carve out a 4-6, 6-4, 7-6(7) victory in a mind-draining three-hour, 22-minute match.
Against Haddad Maia, Fernandez will be taking on a tall, power-hitting rival who is ranked No. 69 in the WTA although the latter has actually set her goal a round ahead – a title clash with Svitolina, the 2020 champion, who she upstaged during her stirring US Women's Open run late last year.
But that won’t happen as the top seeded world No. 15 Ukrainian fell in ambush to Camila Osorio after the gritty Colombian squeaked out a 1-6, 7-5, 7-6(5) reversal earlier before a stunned crowd to crash into the semifinals where the four players are assured of $10,100 in winnings.
Osorio thus set up a Final Four clash with fourth ranked Sara Tormo, who outlasted No. 6 Nuria Diaz, 6-3, 1-6, 6-4, in a duel of Spanish bets."
8,"Max pressure as Sixers, Harden down Cavs","Tyrese Maxey scored 33 points as the Philadelphia 76ers overturned a 21-point deficit to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers 125-119 on Friday (Saturday, Manila time).
Maxey found his scoring touch after the interval with 24 points in the second half as the Sixers extended their winning streak to five games.
New recruit James Harden enjoyed another influential performance with 25 points, 11 assists and three turnovers to maintain his unbeaten start with the Sixers.
Joel Embiid added 22 points while Georges Niang had 17 off the bench and Tobias Harris added 15.
Darius Garland led the Cavaliers scorers with 26 points while Isaac Okoro added 22. Jarrett Allen and Cedi Osman had 20 points apiece.
The Cavs appeared ready to run away with the game after an explosive first quarter, erupting for 43 points to go 21 points clear before Philadelphia gradually clawed back the lead to trail 71-63 at the break.
Maxey then sparked the Sixers into life after halftime as Philadelphia outscored the visitors 62-48 to close out the win.
Maxey said the Sixers' tighter defensive display after the break proved the difference.
""It was all about stops,"" the 21-year-old said. ""They had something like 40 points in the first quarter and that's way too many points. 
""Once we settled in and started getting stops we turned the game around.""
Sixers coach Doc Rivers meanwhile praised the contribution of rising talent Maxey.
""He's just playing great,"" Rivers said.
""I'm on him a lot about being aggressive. Yelled at him about five times tonight. The more he's aggressive, the better we are. 
""He's a fearless kid, he's playing great, and he's getting great shots. He's been great for us.""
The win lifted the Sixers to second in the Eastern Conference at 39-23 before Saturday's road trip against leaders Miami in Florida.
Elsewhere Friday (Saturday in Manila), Giannis Antetokounmpo delivered a 34-point display as the Milwaukee Bucks outlasted the Chicago Bulls 118-112 in another heavyweight Eastern Conference duel.
Antetokounmpo hauled in 16 rebounds and finished with five assists and two steals as the reigning champions showed their pedigree with a gutsy win on the road.
Jrue Holiday added 26 points for Milwaukee while Khris Middleton finished with 22 as the Bucks moved into third place in the standings at 39-25, leapfrogging Chicago in fourth.
Zach LaVine (30 points) and DeMar DeRozan (29) led the Chicago scorers.
The Bulls led by eight points early in the fourth quarter, but were unable to ram home the advantage in the closing stages as Milwaukee finished the stronger."
9,Tiger to the Hall: A look back at Woods’ famed career as he enters the World Golf Hall of Fame,"nduction ceremony slated for next week ahead of the PGA TOUR’s PLAYERS Championship
Ernie Els listened intently to a reporter’s pitch for a story. It dealt with competitive life on the PGA TOUR for players who turn 40 and since Tiger Woods was 39, guess who the question revolved around?
Els, then 45, smiled at that; he had become accustomed to all conversations eventually switching over to Woods. But when the reporter suggested that Woods vs. Els had been a fierce rivalry, the South African laughed.
Shaking his head, Els said emphatically, “He kicked my butt for more than 15 years.”
The reporter attempted to show Els some love, only the four-time major winner continued to shake his head, then repeated, “for more than 15 years.”
It spurred further conversation about how great Woods’ career had been. Els agreed and he suggested you measure numbers against the game’s best. During a good chunk of Woods’ prime, there were four players who arguably ranked closest, but were a notch below – Els, Phil Mickelson, Vijay Singh and Retief Goosen.
In their careers, those four stalwarts combined for 15 major wins; Woods himself matched that figure.
In their careers, those four combined for 105 PGA TOUR wins, but it required 2,118 tournaments, a winning clip of .049. Woods with 82 wins in just 368 starts produces a winning clip of .222.
In their careers, those four combined for just 41 weeks at No. 1 in the world (32 for Singh; nine for Els). Woods was No. 1 for 683 weeks, which is the equivalent of 13 years and two months. Digest that for a moment, savor it, and then realize this: Woods didn’t discriminate just against Els; he kicked everyone’s butt.
“I don’t think there’s a perfect athlete,” Olympic champion Jackie Joyner-Kersee once said. “But if I had to come close to picking someone who demonstrates all the traits … I would say the perfect athlete would be Tiger Woods.”
When it was announced in Spring 2020 that Woods had been elected for induction into the World Golf Hall of Fame (COVID rudely interrupted things; the induction will be March 9 during THE PLAYERS Championship), never was news greeted with such nonchalance.
The man likely deserves his own stratosphere, he’s that utterly incomparable.
Goodness, he had probably done enough to get into the Hall of Fame in just five seasons, 1999-2003, when he won 32 times in 101 starts. Never mind that he tossed down another five-year stretch (2005-09) in which he won 31 of 75 tournaments, or that he was the Jack Nicklaus Player of the Year 10 times, or that he led the money list 10 times, or that he is one of only five players to win the career Grand Slam (let the record show he did it quickest).
It’s as if Mark Calcavecchia nailed it that Sunday in 2000 at the “Home of Golf,” St. Andrews, as he watched Woods nail down an eight-stroke win in the Open Championship just one month after lapping the field by 15 at the U.S. Open.
“He is,” praised Calcavecchia, standing in the cool summer air at The Old Course, “the chosen one.”
Woods was just 24 at the time and halfway to a historic run of four consecutive major wins. He was just getting into his overwhelming dominance of the World Golf Championships (18 triumphs). He had not yet taken ownership of assorted venues such as Bay Hill or Firestone or Torrey Pines.
But he had already proven Phil Knight a prophet.
Just four years earlier, the man behind Nike had said in response to queries about why he would pay such extravagant endorsement money to Woods: “What Michael Jordan did for basketball, (Tiger Woods) absolutely can do for golf. The world has not seen anything like what he’s going to do for the sport.”
Longtime PGA TOUR Commissioner Tim Finchem, also part of this year’s Hall of Fame class, would tell you Knight’s words were not hyperbole. You want numbers, here are some numbers:
In 1998, PGA TOUR players competed for $96.4 million, compared to $328 million in 2016. In 1995 only nine players earned $1 million in prize money and No. 125 on the money list totaled $149,280. Fast-forward to 2021 and 124 players eclipsed that number while No. 125 earned $996,977.
If you don’t accept that Woods is hugely responsible for those upticks, well, you are standing by your lonesome.
“I idolized Arnold Palmer,” said Finchem, “and I respect what Jack (Nicklaus) did. But Tiger Woods is the greatest player and the most dominating. Beyond that, he lifted boats and brought in fans and he’s the most recognizable athlete on the planet.”
That’s pretty good reinforcement for Hall of Fame credentials, in case you even need to back up the key victory numbers that highlights Woods’ resume. (With 82 PGA TOUR wins he shares the career lead with Sam Snead; with 15 majors he trails only Nicklaus.)
But should you still want to know what makes Woods stands out, Finchem offers that “he changed the landscape and he impacted the way golfers prepared and played, which effectively improved TV deals and sponsorships.
“He took golf to a whole new level.”
And now he’ll take his lofty place among the greatest the game has ever known."

14,'We'll be missing a lot': NLEX forced to adjust after McDaniels exit,"The NLEX Road Warriors are on a bittersweet pivot point at the PBA Governor's Cup after playing their final elimination game on Friday.
Despite the joy of being able to assure themselves of a twice-to-beat advantage in the quarterfinals owing to their 8-3 record, the Road Warriors will be absorbing the brunt of losing import KJ McDaniels.

NLEX turn back Ginebra to clinch twice-to-beat edge in McDaniels' swan song
McDaniels, who has been key to the Road Warriors' great performance in the conference, played his final game for NLEX last night as he's set to return to the US in time for his girlfriend giving birth to their child.
Now, with a week of rest before they begin their playoffs bid, NLEX need to adjust to losing one of their most dominant players on the court.
""I don't know how to say it, but if there's anything that can convince KJ to stay, we would do it. But his family is really first priority... We'll be missing a lot,"" admitted NLEX head coach Yeng Guiao after their 115-103 win over Barangay Ginebra.
""We don't know how we will play without him because we've gotten so used to him,"" he added.
McDaniels played all 11 elimination games for NLEX and he tops the league in scoring with norms of 30.36 points per contest.
He also averaged 11.45 rebounds, 3.27 assists, 1.55 steals and 2.82 blocks.
Those numbers will be difficult to fill once he leaves.
And it's not just McDaniels' contribution on the floor that will be affected, but also his teammates who will be left without a friend that they've integrated with on the court.
""[It's] not just the way he plays the game but he's gotten close to a lot of the players. He's really been settling down and then now he needs to go. So, sayang,"" said Guiao.
""Ang laking panghihinayang namin pero we have to move on after KJ and hope that we're still able to play well. Ganun talaga ang buhay. Sayang but we just have to roll with the punches. We just have to make the adjustment,"" he added.
Cameron Clark is expected to attempt to fill the void McDaniels left for NLEX once the quarterfinals roll around.  "

Yet what turned around a Sunday night, FIBA-sanctioned pandemic ballgame were simple, unfancied plays from the visiting New Zealand Tall Blacks. The Kiwis’ 1-5 ball screens worked wonders. Rotations from the top of the three-point line led either to open threes or drives to the basket.
And on the Philippine end, there were familiar scenes: the guard dribbling then driving to either score or dish off either outside or inside, repetitively. The one-on-one Filipino plays also ensued, most of which got stymied by a ferocious Kiwi defense.
With 4:01 left in the game, and a 21-point spread against the home team screaming loud, the over-5,000 Filipino crowd at Araneta hushed in despair.
They and their national basketball team got benched by a running coronavirus pandemic. Nearly two years after, with local vaccination rates high, viral transmission dissipating, and hoops fanaticism howling its return to this arena, Filipinos wanted to watch a fighting national team to keep their hopes up.
Filipinos missed this hoops atmosphere. That night, Filipino fans wished for a big upset win.
“We (Gilas team) didn’t back down. I couldn’t ask for anything more form our players,” said national coach Chot Reyes in the post-game presser. Yet out of a 51-67 deficit, the 21-9 blast that the Tall Blacks dropped in the final 8:23 just dampened Filipinos’ spirits.
Most of ‘who can play’ for flag
The Philippines, host of the 2023 FIBA World Cup, returned to an international stage wherein countries playing in these postponed World Cup Qualifiers make the most of who can play for them.
The NBA and the various national leagues went on, and the national stars can’t take time out now and play for flag. National teams played with mostly their second or third-tier players, with a few stars steering them. Some had “stars” like former Olympians and World Cup veterans, but they’re in their early 40s (like Carlos Delfino of Argentina, or former NBA All-Star Joe Johnson of the United States).
Upsets happened in these windows. Tiny Iceland surprised 2020 Olympic qualifiers Italy. Scrappy Kazakhstan surprised two-time Asian champion Iran. War-ravaged South Sudan upset reigning African champions Tunisia.  
The  Philippines had other reasons to play in these FIBA World Cup windows, as well as last year’s FIBA tournaments like the Asian Cup qualifiers in Pampanga, and a leg of the Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Belgrade, Serbia. Those reasons can be summed up in four numbers: 2-0-2-3.
Playing for 2023
As early as 2018, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas formed a “23-for-2023” pool from mostly the collegiate ranks. SBP then worked with the PBA to arrange for dispersal drafts — that college players be drafted first by Gilas then play later on for their PBA teams.
When the Philippines qualified for the 2019 FIBA World Cup in China, lack of preparation time for coach Yeng Guiao’s squad proved fatal: the Philippines ended up dead last in the 32-team tournament. On the side, SBP tried to spruce up the 23-player pool, subjecting them to a dedicated training program similar to the early-1980s experiment with Northern Consolidated Cement (NCC).
Then the coronavirus pandemic came. Tournaments worldwide screeched to a halt. The world waited for a year for vaccines to be developed and inoculated to most of the world’s seven billion people.
A pandemic’s wrath
The pandemic derailed countries’ basketball programs.
Tab Baldwin got the task of handling the 23-for-2023 program. But Filipino basketball players, including members of that 23-player pool, were aching to play ball. The chance came in June last year: the FIBA Asia Cup qualifiers in Clark, Pampanga that included twin wins over Korea.
Building up from that bubble tournament, the Philippines got a surprise call to play in the FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Belgrade a month after (New Zealand backed out).
Baldwin and his scrappy youngers almost pulled the rug off on the favored Serbian team. NBA veterans Milos Teodosic and 7’5” Boban Marjanovic towed the Serbians to that ugly 83-76 win, with coach Igor Kokoškov admitting: “We had an off night, but we had to find a way to win the game.”
The FIBA Asia Cup was supposed to be staged in Indonesia last August, but the Delta surge ravaged the country and the tournament was moved to this August.
Leagues in the Asia-Pacific then pirated some from the 23-member pool since mid-last year, including Dwight Ramos, Kobe Paras, Juan and Javi Gomez de Liano, 7’2” Kai Sotto, and Jordan Heading.
Gilas Pilipinas got stuck, and SBP’s Chair Emeritus Manny Pangilinan got concerned. Then Baldwin resigned as head coach, especially given concerns for his ailing brother. Details of his exit were sudden and remain unclear, as SBP tagged Reyes to continue Baldwin’s program.
Missing a ‘playing style’?
When the third quarter saw the Filipino dribble-drive offense getting obstructed, the Tall Blacks’ half-court set plays that ballooned their lead typified how Filipinos still play catch-up in international play.
Off a Philippine timeout in quarter 3, two gentlemen sitting at row 2 of section 405 and a stout guy at row 1 howled: “We want Baldwin!” The three voices slowly grew to a few, with some claps accompanying that chant. Those few shouts from the other side of Araneta got heard during the Philippine timeout.
Look at the plays of New Zealand, says the stout, outspoken “Ramil” during the first quarter. “They’re playing like Ateneo de Manila University.”
The Blue Eagles is Baldwin’s collegiate hoops nest, and his team’s adoption of the international style of play led to two straight UAAP titles. Baldwin’s style of play almost made the Philippines beat Serbia last August, even if “Teodosic’s ball screen plays were tough to handle.”
A ‘long way to go’
As early as the Philippines’ win over lowly India last Feb. 25, Reyes said the Philippine team still “has a long way to go” to develop a competitive 2023 team. “This is a long-term program,” Reyes said, referring to forming a proud Philippine team for 2023.
The 23-for-2023 pool got somewhat dismantled as some of the members have already signed up for PBA teams. The young turks returned to their UAAP teams. The Filipinos in Japan’s B-League, Taiwan’s T1 League and Australia’s National Basketball League (NBL) got themselves settled.
Reyes had to borrow his PBA team Talk N’ Text for this Philippine window. If there’s any consolation, New Zealand last played as a team nearly two years ago. Many of the national teams worldwide prepared with limited time for this window.
Against Gilas Sunday night, the Tall Blacks and its mostly younger players (including two Filipino-Kiwis) did what’s typical of the FIBA game.
The 2023 FIBA World Cup is set to feature the new generation of Filipino players, with Reyes tagging B-League stalwarts Ravena and Ramos as the new leaders. Yet days before these qualifying window matches, news buzzed: who should make the 2023 national team?
For now, with the Asian Games and the FIBA Asia Cup looming, Reyes told journalists SBP will meet with the PBA “to synchronize calendars”.
When asked who should make those teams, Reyes said “I cannot answer that question because we (SBP and the PBA) have to sit down and craft the plan.”
After Sunday night’s loss, hushes of despair from Filipino fans enveloped the Araneta Coliseum. Fans knew Gilas was simply outplayed by the Tall Blacks, plain and simple.
“We still have a lot (of things) to work on,” Reyes said."
16,"Sotto, 36ers handed third straight NBL loss","Kai Sotto and the Adelaide 36ers could not get back into the win column after losing steam in the endgame against South East Melbourne (SEM) Phoenix, 76-83, at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre on Friday.
Adelaide rode a Daniel Johnson-led comeback in the fourth quarter after trailing by as much as 13 points and even took the lead, 74-73, with 2:24 ticks left in the game.
But a 10-2 run by the Phoenix to end the game kept Adelaide slumping.
Sotto had quality minutes off the bench in the loss as he finished with four points, nine rebounds, two assists, one steal and three blocks.
Johnson paced Adelaide as the only player in twin-digit scoring with 31 points.
Mitchell Creek, for his part, led the Phoenix to victory with 29 points, seven rebounds and five assists.
Adelaide fell to 5-10 in the standings while the Phoenix are 11-5 to maintain their place at No. 2."
17,Del Rosario vows comeback after early miscue in Epson Tour,"Pauline del Rosario closed out her first Epson Tour foray as a full-time campaigner the way she started it — with a miscue — as she hobbled with a 74 in windy conditions to trail Korean Min-G Kim by seven in the Florida’s Natural Charity Classic in Winter Haven, Florida Friday.
She was actually on her way to checking a rollercoaster backside start with a run of pars at the front but flubbed a couple of chances and overshot the par-5 No. 9 of the Country Club of Winter Haven that puts premium on precise approach play for its elevated, turtle-shell shape greens.
Del Rosario ended up with a bogey and a pair of 37s that dropped her to a share of 47th, just within the Top 60-plus ties cut bracket.
“My ball-striking wasn’t at its best. It’s windy so it was easy to get into difficult positions,” rued the late-starting del Rosario, who overshot the 9th green with her 3-wood second shot. “I had a tough time pitching from below since most of the greens here are elevated.”
Fil-Am Clariss Guce, meanwhile, struggled coming off a long layoff, fumbling with a frontside 37 then dropping three straight strokes from No. 12 before holing out with birdie for a 75.
The two-time Symetra Tour, now the Epson Tour, winner lay at joint 66th in a 132-player starting field and would need to shoot in the 60s to make it to the final round of the $200,000, 54-hole championship kicking off the Road to the LPGA.
The top 10 after the 20-leg circuit will earn cards for next year’s edition of the world’s premier ladies tour.
Unlike Guce, the ICTSI-backed del Rosario stepped into the fray exuding confidence coming off a victory in the East Coast Women’s Pro Tour two weeks ago. But she bogeyed No. 10, regained the stroke on No. 13, only to yield it again on the next.
She dropped another stroke on the 17th but birdied the par-5 18th.
“I know the courses on the Epson Tour are more demanding in terms of conditions, length, firmness of the greens unlike on other tours,” rued del Rosario, who played on the Women’s All Pro Tour and the East Coast Tour as part of her buildup for the LPGA’s farm league. “But definitely, I can do better.”
She must since another over-par round may drop her out of the Sunday cast.
“The course actually isn’t difficult, playing just over 6,500 yards,” said del Rosario, who hopes to cash in on an 8:28 a.m. tee-start with Aussie Gabriella Ruffels, who also made a 74, and American Jessica Welch, who groped for a 76. “But it was windy and the greens are hard and fast.”
Kim, meanwhile, came armed to the teeth, draining five birdies for a solid 67 that put her in front by one of Gabby Lemieux of the US, India’s Nishta Madan and Swede Frida Kinhult, who all carded 68s, while Hong Kong’s Tiffany Chan and Weiwei Zhang of China matched 69s."

20,TNT returns from Gilas break with rout of Blackwater,"The TNT Tropang Giga showed little rust in their first game back from a week-long break with a convincing win over the hapless Blackwater Bossing, X106-93, in the PBA Governors' Cup at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on Friday.
Returning from a tour of Gilas duty, the Tropang Giga made light work of the Bossing and notched their third straight win to improve to 5-4.
The Philippine Cup champions leaned on a balanced offensive attack led by Mikey Williams and Aaron Fuller to send Blackwater to the brink of yet another winless conference and their 29th consecutive defeat.
Though it was not a total walk in the park for the TNT with the Bossing playing at pace with them in the first two quarters of the game.
The game was in a 29-all deadlock after a JVee Casio triple with 5:58 left in the second period.

The Bossing fought to keep their heads afloat in the second half but faltered against the more powerful TNT offense.
TNT led by as much as 20 points in the wire-to-wire victory.
Williams led TNT in the scoring column with 23 points while Fuller finished with a double-double of 16 points and 22 rebounds.
