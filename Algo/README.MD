# Test Cases
## Test Cases Defenition
The parameters for each algorithm in the different cases are the best one that the researchers found from testing.

## Test case 1
Algorithm Test with the following feature: Count Vectorizer and Tfid Transformer. <br/>

## Test case 2
Algorithm Test with the feature Count Vectorizer. <br/>

## Test case 3
Algorithm Test with the feature Tfidf Vectorizer. <br/>

## Test case 4
This test is where the combination of multiple algorithms will be tested using voteclass classifier. <br/>
