In just 5 hours or so, the letter generated 26,300+ hearts out of the 37,000+ reactions to the said letter.
In the letter, Mrs. Clemencia Garcia of Navotas, a fish vendor told BBM to accept the little amount she donated as her contribution to BBM’s campaign so that he can continue helping the country.
A closer look at the photo of BBM and the woman, it can be gleaned that the two have swollen and watery eyes, which offered as an explanation why Thinking Pinoy’s post is going very viral in just a matter of hours.
Let us read the comments of netizens below.
Netizen #1 commented that the Nanay Clemencia’s gesture touched her so much that is why she loves Nanay Clemencia.
I was so touched of her gesture even up to the last centavo of her money she insisted that she will give it to BBM. Nanay Clemencia’s love and support for BBM is unconditional and overflowingLove na love kita Nanay Clemencia
Netizen #2, a dude, confessed that Nanay Clemencia’s gesture made him shed tears.
I cried watching that. The lovely lady displayed not only her support for BBM but her love of her country.
Netizen #3 commented that indeed love conquers hate hence BBM-Sara tandem continue to dominate in the scientific surveys.
Love trumps hate. And this is why the BBM-SARA ticket consistently dominate the scientific polls. They benefit from support that is given because of love for them and not because of hate for their opponents.
Netizen #4 wrote a very moving remark on the gesture of the fish vendor and the photo shared by BBM and Nanay Clemencia, the fish vendor.
There is something pure and beautiful about this. An inspiration. A patriotic romance. A kindled hope. A fervent prayer for the betterment of our country. Faith that can move mountains. Purity of soul. Connection. Unity. Organic beauty. 
Netizen #5 can’t help but notice how Nanay Clemencia looked at BBM.
Those eyes that full of love and support he needs that now

2,Ang MEMA ng mga kandidatong pipili ng PPP over ODA – Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Chu,"Manila Bulletin writer Krizette Laureta Chu slammed the presidential candidate who made a commitment to continue the Duterte admin’s Build Build Build program.
Chu is critical of PPP because of several reasons. 1. it is an oligarch-controlled projects. 2. the government will incur debt of gratitude to businessmen. 3. the businessmen will dictate the terms 4. many of them will also serve as the project implementers.
Chu said ODA-driven (Overseas Development Assistance) Build Build Build program is better than PPP because the terms of loan is very favorable to the government like long grace period before the government starts paying and low interest rates for over a long period of time.
But, he/she will prefer PPP (Public-Private Partnership) over ODA (Overseas Development Assistance) so that the government will stop taking in debts. The presidential candidate said to ensure success PPP, he/she will make sure to put government in order first so that more and more investors will have faith in government.
That is why ODA is more like an aid than a loan, Chu argued. This also explains why the Duterte government has only 5% PPP of its Build Build Build projects.
Chu also added that only a small portion of our Build Build Build projects are linked with China so their concern that China will use it as a sovereignty issue is baseless.
You may now read Chu’s original FB post.
Ang MEMA ng mga kandidatong pipili ng PPP over ODA.
MEMA!!!! with PPP, It’s your usual oligarch controlled infra. Utang na loob sa mga negosyante. Tapos terms pa nila ang masusunod. MANY OF THEM, sila ANG gagawa.
Samantalang ang ODA, they will give you a long grace period before you start payment, then you will pay a very very low interest, ang alam ko even as low as 5 percent, over a period of 30 years na parang PAG IBIG, na the inflation will pay for it.
Kaya nga ODA kasi it’s more like an aid than a loan.
KAYA NGA only 5 percent of our BBB is PPP kasi better ang ODA.
Hindi naman China pinaka malaking nagpautang sa atin if they’re going to use it as a sovereignty issue.
Naku tabi ang mga Presidential candidates, AKO ANG MAKIKIPAG DEBATE
Former Assistant Secretary for Communications and Commuter Affairs of the Department of Transportation and Communications Goddes Hope Libiran wrote a lengthy comment to further enlighten netizens why Chu was correct that ODA is better than PPP.
It will be academically enlightening for the Memas to review the loan terms of our current railway projects, where it may be of interest for them to learn that principal debt payments for most of these projects will not even start until after 12 years. For example— the JAPAN (JICA) ODA loan for the Metro Manila Subway and MRT-3 Rehabilitation Projects have a grace period of 12 years. It is payable over 40 years, with a concessionary interest rate of 0.1% per annum. This means the government will not start paying for the principal borrowed for these projects until the 12th year, when the projects are already completed, operational, and benefitting the public.And for the record, you are correct KLC Happy Thoughts and Cellphone Repair, in saying that China is not our primary source of ODA financing. As far as DOTr railway projects are concerned, number 1 ang Japan, followed by the Asian Development Bank, then China is third.

3,Atty. Trixie weighs why black propaganda vs BBM continues in light of the so-called El Figlio study commissioned by Leni camp,"In light of the unabated bashing and black propaganda thrown at BBM from the camp of the Pinklawans, Atty. Trixie of the Luminous can’t help but resurrect the so-called El Figlio study which was commissioned by the Robredo camp.
In case you forgot the El Figlio study, basically it says that every time they bash BBM, the more his popularity grow.
Atty. Trixie remarked that the continued black propaganda against BBM from the Pinklawan camp could only mean two things: 1. they forgot about it 2. Leni lacks leadership to control her supporters.
On that note, Atty. Trixie remarked that if they are asking for an online war, the UniTeam are not scared because they have been practicing for the last 6 years.
Netizens jumped into the comment section to share their opinion on Atty. Trixie’s FB post.
Netizens echoed Atty. Trixie’s observation that Leni indeed lacks the leadership skill because she can’t even make her supporters follow her lead.
If she can’t have them follow her preaching, then she’s not really an effective leader. Alam nyo na ang ending 
This netizen thinks Robredo’s campaign strategists are even sabotaging her own campaign.
I have a feeling that their campaign strategists are not going to vote for their nanay, the strategists were actually sabotaging her after realizing, maybe after realizing that their nanay has really no leadership qualities and no bright ideas coming from her.
Another netizen commented that Robredo is to blame for failing to take advantage of the result of the El Figlio.
Eh ung Ina naman po nila pasimuno ng pambabash Kay BBM. Simula ng filing ng COC puro sila BBM. Walang bukambibig kundi si BBM. Hindi makapangampanya ng Hindi babanggitin si BBM.
Let me end by sharing the comment from a netizen because in my opinion, he/she echoed the sentiment of many BBM-Sara supporters who are silent readers on social media.
Right! Binugbug sa insulto ang pro uniteam! So we ‘fight’ back! But no amount of explanation is enough for the camp of Leni! Pikon! Alam lng nila i-cancel those who do not agree w/ them! So be it! Sabi nga, ‘bring it on’!
You may now read Atty. Trixie’s original FB post below.
Di ba dati may commissioned study ang kabila na tuwing binabash si BabyM, lalong sumisikat? (El Figlio)
Well, either nakakalimutan nila yon or…wala talagang leadership yung inanila. Di sya sinusunod sa panawagan niyang maging mahinahon, mag explain, mag explain pa some more…
Eh kung bardagulan ang gusto nila, anim na taon nang nakapagpractise ang mga pro UniTeam.

4,"GenSan resident disagrees Leni-Kiko, local media claim GenSan is pink, says teenagers went there to watch free RiverMaya concert","The photo below, which has been making the rounds on social media, is a drone shot of the crowd that attended the Leni-Kiko campaign rally in GENSAN.
Manila Bulletin and other local news networks has been sharing tight drone shots of every Leni-Kiko campaign rallies, apparently to give the public the impression that wherever Leni-Kiko team goes, they are huge crowd drawers.
Manila Bulletin
Turned out, Kiko Pangilinan, Robredo’s VP tandem, was among the first to share the same photo of Manila Bulletin.
In a social media post, Pangilinan described the sight at the GenSan Oval Plaza “punong-puno” because people wants to show they are taking a stand with #Leni-Kiko2022.
However, a native of GenSan (General Santos) has taken to Facebook to prove Kiko Pangilinan’s claim that the Leni-Kiko team filled up the Oval Plaza in GenSan to make a stand with the #Leni-Kiko2022 tandem isn’t true.
John Mark Segovia Egay of General Santos City showed a satellite image of the GenSan Oval Plaza and the actual drone shot photo of the event to prove that Kiko was incorrect to say that the GenSan Oval Plaza was “punong-puno” during their campaign rally.
Below is the original caption of Egay in his FB post.
Para klaro jud ug masabtan unsa kadaghan ang tao nag gamit najud ug satellite ug drone ha. Ana man mo gusto nnyug research. Unta di mangaway! To make it clear and easily understood by people the size of the crowd, I used a satellite and drone shot photos because Leni-Kiko supporters told him to do some research.
As of this writing, John Mark Segovia Egay’s FB post has been reposted by the FB page VOVph, eliciting positive reactions from netizens.
This netizen commented that the crowd who attended Leni-Kiko’s campaign rally in GenSan was not that huge as the photo shared by Kiko and Manila Bulletin wants the public to believe. She said she went there personally and saw the venue. Claimed that crowd consisted mostly of teenagers who went there to watch the River Maya concert. She also shared a photo she took at the venue. The rest are Magdalo and Anakbayan members.
Hindi totoo yan. Sa likod ako ng stage bumaba, nakita ko pa nga yung Magdalo, di ko alam kung si Trililing ba yun sumasakay ng suv. Ang luwag, nilakad ko pa ikot sa harap, panay mga tyangge na. Literal ang mga teenagers nasa harap ng stage at marami sa kanila mga BBM SARA! Hinabol talaga si River Maya. Namura pa at bat 3 kanta lang daw spotted Anakbayan. yan na malapit yan sa stage.

Another netizen GenSan echoed the sentiment of her kababayan from GenSan.

5,"Basa din minsan minsan, Father — Atty. Trixie to Pari_Koy who takes a swipe at Duterte admin because of the rising prices of gasoline","A Catholic priest using the alias Pari_Koy on Twitter has taken a swipe at the Duterte administration amid the rising prices of fuels by asking if there is still an existing government in the Philippines?
On that note, Atty. Trixie of the Luminous wasted no time in rebuking Pari_Koy for dipping his hands into politics and the economy in particular.
Atty. Trixie quizzed Pari_Koy about his understanding of the concept of governance? Does it have supernatural powers? Powerful enough to fend off the market forces? Does it have a shield against the effects of war and sanctions?
Atty. Trixie advised Pari_Koy to read once in a while.
Atty. Trixie wrapped up the brief FB post by leaving the readers the moral lesson of the story: When the uninformed joined forces, it’s a dangerous mixed indeed.
Ano ba ang konsepto ninyo ng gobyerno, Father? May supernatural powers? Kayang salagin ang market forces? May shield laban sa epekto ng gyera at sanctions?

Basa din minsan minsan, Father.

Delikado talaga mag sanib pwersa ang mga uninformed.
Here are some of the epic reactions from netizens below.
Netizen #1 advised Pari_Koy not to emulate their “lutang” Mother.
padre huwag gayahin ang ina nyong lutang..parang pilipinas lang ang laging hirap ahh..apektado po lahat pati europa..mas super mataas ang bilihin sa amin dito at hindi rin tumataas ang suweldo nmin..kya pwede ba huwag sisihin ang gobyerno.. mgdasal ka na lang para bumuti ang ang mundo.. hindi puro tutok sa lutang mong ina
Netizen #2 joked that we should vote for the candidate Pari_Koy endorses because no matter if war erupts, they can make the price of gasoline go down.
may supernatural power si pader kaya iboto nyo ang inindorso nila kahit anong gyera mapaoamura nila ang gasolina
Netizen #3 commented to inform Pari_Koy that gasoline prices are up anywhere in the world, including Europe.
Father hnd lng po jn sa pinas mataas ang gasolina lalo na po dine sa europa at hnd lng po gasilina ang mataas lht po tumaas na….omg father kinig2 at basa2 dn po ng international news….hnd po un banat lng ng banat

6,Netizen debunks GMA News and Rappler reports re BBM-Sara tandem gave P500 to rally attendees in Nueva Ecija?,"An irate BBM-Sara supporter slammed GMA News and Rappler for making baseless allegation against the UniTeam in relation to their Nueva Ecija campaign rally recently.
In a Facebook post entitled “PROPAGANDA”, the UniTeam supporter took to social media to debunk the news report from GMA New and Rappler that attendees of the BBM-Sara campaign rally in Nueva Ecija received P500 each. You can check the screenshots of the articles from GMA News and Rappler below to fill you in.
According to the BBM-Sara supporter, the attendees who were caught on camera receiving envelopes with P500 inside were actually recipients of “Alagang Umali” program of Nueva Ecija Governor Oyie Matias-Umali.
The netizen explained said program distributes not only financial aid but also rice, fish sauce, vinegar etc. to Nueva Ecija residents. The program predates the pandemic and distribution of assistance became more frequent because of the pandemic to help Nueva Ecija residents. Nueva Ecija residents receive aid regardless of political color. See the attached photo below of the “Alagang Umali” stubs given to Nueva Ecija residents as proof that the P500 came from Gov. Umali, not from UniTeam.
The BBM-Sara supporter said it was mere coincidence that the venue for the financial aid distribution to the recipients of the “Alagang Umali” happened to be the lunch area of the Uniteam because they have a scheduled rally and caravan in Talavera later.
The Uniteam held a mini-rally for the recipients of the “Alagang Umali” claimed the netizen.
Moving forward, the BBM-Sara supporter said she was highly disappointed because of what she read in the news was contrary to what she witnessed personally.
The BBM-Sara supporter ended the FB rant by lecturing GMA News and Rappler the principles of news reporting instead of churning out news article peppered with “allegedly” or “raw/daw” word, a tell-tale sign they did not do their jobs in news reporting.
You may now read the original FB post below.
This is my first time posting about politics and how media depict it in their very own way.
“PROPAGANDA”
Para po sa kaalaman ng lahat, ang mga taong binigyan ng 500 cash ay from Sta. Rosa dahil sila po ay Alagang Umali. Ito po ay paayuda para sa mga tao. Kahit hindi pa po eleksyon, matagal nang nagbibigay ng financial assistance, bulto-bultong bigas, patis, suka, toyo etc. ang Umali. Nadalas lang po ang pagbibigay dahil sa dulot ng hirap sa pandemya. By batch nga po ang kuha ng ayuda from other areas.
Natapat naman po sa venue ng Alagang Umali na doon pala ang lunch area ng Uniteam bandang 12 noon dahil sila ay may scheduled rally at caravan sa Talavera. Kaya naman nagkaroon ng mini rally ang Uniteam para sa mga aayudahan ni Gov. Umali. Kaya nga ang sinasabi ng mga nandon ay “Maswerte kayo dahil dito rin pala ang lunch area ng Uniteam.”
Mula po sa senators, vice president, at president na nandoon ay nagbigay po sila nang kanilang mga plataporma gaya ng MSME management, libreng tablet para sa mga studyante, paano paunlarin ang pagsasaka at mga programa sa farmers at marami pang iba, pero syempre ang pinakahighlight po na kanilang iminumungkahi ay Unity, kaya binanggit po nila ‘yoon bago matapos ang kanilang mga speech.
Ang mga taong naririnig nyo naman po na sumisigaw ng “Hindi kami bayaran” ay ang mga taong nagpunta at sumuporta sa Scheduled Rally ng Uniteam sa Talavera. Dahil wala naman po talagang binayaran doon at pinilit, kusa po at kung sino lang ang may gusto ang nagpunta doon.
Samakatuwid, ang mga Alagang Umali sa Sta. Rosa ay maswerte lamang dahil nadatnan sila ng Uniteam at wala naman talagang binayaran sa mga tao mula sa Talavera sa kanilang scheduled rally.
Nakakadisappoint lang po mismo mapanood ito sa balita dahil ako mismo yung nandoon, at alam ng lahat ng nandoon na hindi naman ganito ang daloy at totoong nangyari.
Sa katunayan ang paayuda ng Alagang Umali ay bukas sa lahat ng tao, kahit sino pa man ang sinusuportahan mong partido dahil mayroon po akong katabi na isang Kakampink at Leni supporter.
Sa isang banda, bakit puro nakared at green ang mga taong Alagang Umali? Kami po ay binigyan lamang ng tshirt na BBM-SARA (red/green) noong sinabi na doon pala ang lunch area ng Uniteam kaya karamihan ay nakagreen at red na ang suot. Noong pinamigay po iyon, marami po sa amin ang kumuha at nagsuot pero meron din po na tumanggi at hindi nagsuot.
Alamin nyo po muna ang totoong nangyayari on the ground bago kayo magpublish at magpabalas ng mga balita nyo na ang puro statement ay may “daw/raw”. Verified po ang inyong mga page at kayo po ay pinakikinggan at pinanonood ng maraming tao, simpleng pagsulat lang po ng balita with factual statements hindi nyo po pala kaya maibigay, as a previous campus journalist nakakahiya po kayo.
Ps. Sa mga gustong mangcancel ayos lang po, turo nga sa amin ni Inday Sara “Kapag kayo ay kinansel, batuhin lang namin kayo ng burger.” Maaaring corny sa pandinig pero wag na po tayo mag-away away dahil wala naman po itong magandang maidudulot.

7,Edu Manzano said West Philippine Sea is ours but other countries are stealing it from us and Leni Robredo will make sure what is ours is ours,"A campaign ad video of Edu Manzano talking about the West Philippine Sea and Leni Robredo is the only leader who will make sure what is ours is ours, “ang atin ay atin”.
In the video, Manzano opened by praising the country’s beauty. That wherever he and partner Cherry Pie traveled, they said nothing compared to our very own country, especially our seas.
Almost 80% of the Philippines is surrounded by the sea, including the West Philippine Sea which is 3.5 million sq. km, rich with natural resources.
Manzano said that the West Philippine Sea check all the boxes like food, livelihood and one of the country’s richest in terms of natural resources.
That is why there some countries who are stealing it from the Philippines. Foreigners who are harassing our fishermen as if we have no right to enjoy our own natural resources, which he said does not tick our boxes.
Manzano said that the Philippines need to fight for what is ours. And with that, we need a leader who is ready to fight for what is ours. This is what Leni Robredo said about the West Philippine Sea.
That is why some of our retired members of the Armed Forces have expressed their belief that VP Leni Robredo is the only leader who is capable, intellect and courage to become President and Commander-in-Chief, Manzano bragged.
Manzano insisted, Robredo will fight for the Philippines for Filipinos.
With Leni Robredo, we are certain, what is ours is ours, a confident Manzano said.
On that note, International Relations expert Sass Rogando Sasot took to Facebook to ask Edu Manzano if he read the South China Sea Arbitration because he made a convincing pitch that Leni Robredo is the only one who can resolve the WPS issue.
Si Edu Manzano ay may commercial na sinasabi na si Leni raw ang maka-resolba ng WPS issue. Ninanakaw raw ng dayuhan ang WPS. Sir Edu, nabasa nyo po ba ang South China Sea Arbitration decision?
Sasot’s FB post asking Edu Manzano if he really what he was talking about made 8,000+ laugh out of the 11,000+ reactions of netizens.

8,Direk Manny Castaneda to church leaders meddling in politics: Konting delicadeza naman sana ng kahit pano ay magmukha silang kagalangalang,"Movie director and veteran actor Manuel Castaneda aka Manny Castaneda is calling out some Catholic church leaders because of shameless abuses on the principle of the separation of the Church and the State.
Direk Manny Castaneda, which many Filipinos will agree, noted that the principle of the separation of the Church and the State is not strictly observed in the country.
For some reason, Filipinos have been very kind and patient with the Church meddling in government affairs.
But in this election, some Catholic priest has been actively leaning towards a certain candidate while attacking the candidate they don’t like. Castaneda is apparaently fed up with this because in his personal opinion, it has overstepped the boundary of what is acceptable, hence he is urging fellow Filipinos to the same.
Castaneda appealed to Church leaders to have some delicadeza, if they anything left, so that they will still have this aura of respectability to the laity.
You may now read Direk Manny Castaneda’s FB post.
It is obvious that the separation of church and state is not strictly applied in the Philippines. Somehow we have gotten used with the church encroaching in affairs of the state. However, there has been some abuses committed by some religious sectors. Masyado ng garapal! Konting delicadeza naman sana ng kahit pano ay magmukha silang kagalangalang.
Here are some of the comments of netizens from the thread.
This netizen felt sad that instead of doing their job as priest, they are promoting hate and divisiveness among Filipinos.
Nakakalungkot – instead on enlightening people on the virtue of gratitude and appreciation for us all who survived and are surviving this pandemic and prayers to those who prematurely lost to the sickness – they are actually sowing hate and divisiveness. Makes one question – are these really people of the Church they ought to be?
One netizen wants the Church to pay taxes.
Time for them to pay taxes direk Manuel Castaneda!
And another… Singgilin na yan ng taxes para kahit mamulitika, ok lang.Remove excemptions from taxes.
A third one confessed they have stopped going to mass because of the Church meddling in politics.
That’s why we stopped going to mass a very long time ago. They preach hate instead of love and forgiveness!

9,Video of checking of attendance in Leni Robredo’s Iloilo City campaign rally circulates online,"When BBM visited Negros recently, some supporters of Leni Robredo accused the BBM camp of giving free rides to Negrenses to and fro the proclamation rally at BREDCO reclamation area in Bacolod City.
In addition, there were also allegation that those who attended the BBM-Sara rally in Negros were paid P200.
200 pesos. Ahay Negros Bugtaw! https://t.co/M18iDygudG
— LABAN LENI (@blessytot14) February 23, 2022
The FB page Negros for BBM fired back by sharing a video, apparently to show that the saying “thinkers are doers” are essentially true.
Meanwhile, in Iloilo City. While we were accused in Negros of “hakot”, Leni Supporters in turn ended up having an attendance check. What an irony.
In the video, a male voice can be heard telling his friends to have their attendance check so that they can go home.
The OP later did not explain what was the checking of attendance all about but one netizen volunteered an information that gives us the clue who were those required to pass their attendance – contractuals from the LGU. Otherwise, their contracts will not be renewed.
The OP shared this screenshot photo and wrote: Kaya naman pala dumami, pati students at hindi reshistro pinapasama kasi may concert daw lol
Here are some of the comments from netizens.
One netizen wrote that this is the only way to gather crowd. Many are willing because where else can you get free food and even money.
No other way to get a crowd.. make a Hakot the people and bayad them with free food..Asan ka nyan ..pakainin pa ,mi pera ka pa
This netizen quipped that Leni’s popularity is more credible if this phenomenon happens also during caravans, not just in meet and greet. The netizen added that having large crowds in grand rally than in caravans makes him suspicious.
Mas kapani paniwala tlga qng sa caravan dnudumog hnd lang sa meet and greet. Mas nakaka suspetsa ung madami sa grand rally kesa sa caravan…Parang mas masasabi qng hnd bayaran yung patiently wait sa kalsada kesa pumunta ng grand rally na may banda at madaming artista.
Another netizen commented that Robredo’s proclamation rally in Iloilo City was well attended because of something else.
Nag concert kasi si Ely Buendia nang eraserheads Kaya daw dami dumalo
Another BBM supporter slammed the Kakampinks for accusing BBM of having “hakot” crowd, but this video she said is worse.
Puro bintang na may hakot si BBM ito mas masaklap may attendance pa
Meanwhile, this netizen defended the checking attendance saying that as per covid protocol, attendance is a must for tracing purposes.

Unless there’s a video of BBM murdering someone, how can Leni, Pacquiao, and Isko even catch up 80 days before the elections?
Netizens seem to approve Krizette Chu’s observation as shown in the comments below.
Nil, Zilch. BBM and his family comport themselves with kindness, grace, and compassion even towards people who call them names. BBM and SDC adhered to their mantra not to succumb to negative campaigning but invest in what they can do. This is the change brought about by the good administration of PRRD. 
There is a video of BBM k!lling Pinklawans with kindness and love. May nadaanan silang Pinklawans who were shouting “magnanakaw” and he waved at them, blew them kisses and shouted “I love you”.This man clearly knows how a leader should react. I think my vote is now final.
They can’t beat BBM sawa na kc ang mga tao sa mga self righteous, feeling elite kakampink. Ilang yrs na ring sinisira ng mga ito ang mga Marcos but tahimik lng sila. Now Diyos at masa na ang mag aangat sa kanila. 
They won’t. Clear as crystal that Marcos is the new president of election 2022…..The force of Marcos and Inday Sara for 6 years will be tsunamic. Economy will back up, trust of government will be maintained and infrastructure will be more awesome. Marcos and Inday Sara’ s survey are both individually massive because even for simple minded and ordinary citizen like me( and we are millions)- and not even politics fanatical- see the simple yet very clearly, of those 3 things mentioned above in the being of Marcos and Inday Sara….My beloved President Duterte  is the savior and Marcos and Inday Sara are the disciples.

Tulad ni Toni Gonzaga, maraming mga artista at mga taga showbiz ang hindi boboto kay Leni Robredo pero tahimik lamang lang sila dahil sa mga pinklawan na masyadong agresibo, pala away at saksakan ng bastos. At kapansin pansin din na lalong dumadami ang mga artista na umaayaw kay Leni dahil din sa mga masamang ugali ng mga Pinklawan.

12,Did Leni Robredo plagiarize St. Ignatius of Loyola’s prayer? This twitter netizen thinks so and FB netizens erupt in laughter,"A Twitter netizen using the handle @LeBrat02996201 has bravely confronted Leni Robredo on Twitter and accusing the Vice president of not only mangling the prayer of St. Ignatius of Loyola but copying it without even giving the courtesy of crediting the original. In other words, he accused the VP of plagiarism.
Let us consult google what is the meaning of plagiarism.
Merriam Webster: the act of using another person’s words or ideas without giving credit to that person : the act of plagiarizing something.
On Facebook, social media influencer MJ Quiambao Reyes shared the screenshot of Robredo’s tweet, including the tweet reply of @LeBrat02996201 for context. In a sarcastic tone, Reyes praised Robredo’s writing skills.
ANG HUSAY NI MAMA
Credit nga pala to St. Ignatius of Loyola & to Maria Bratikova

13,BBM’s kin defends Toni Gonzaga from lies peddled in media chat groups she supposedly got paid Php120M for her support for BBM?,"On innuendos being peddled by Toni Gonzaga’s critics that she has been paid P120M for her support for BBM?
Fake news says Mike Acebedo Lopez, a relative of BBM from the Romualdez side.
An apparently irked Lopez asked what is with people nowadays? Each time other people support someone they don’t like, they’re automatically paid?
Lopez lectured the rumor-mongers that in life, there are layers of reasons that makes people subscribe to the politics of a certain politician, intangibles so they say like principles, values and personal relationship. Like for example, Toni Gonzaga’s husband Paul Soriano is Liza Araneta Marcos nephew? BBM is not only wedding ‘Ninong’ of Toni and Paul’s wedding, they have blood connections too.
You may now read Mike Acebedo Lopez’s original FB post for your enlightenment below.
So lies are now being peddled in media chat groups that Toni was supposedly paid Php120M for her support for BBM.
Gosh, what is it with these people and money? Each time other people support someone you don’t like they’re automatically paid? Bayaran kaagad? There are a bunch of other reasons that motivate people when they choose their brand of politics (or politicians), intangibles like principles, values, and personal relationships that make them see things from a different perspective.
In Toni’s case, did you know that her husband, Paul Del Mar Soriano, is the blood nephew of BBM’s wife, Liza Cacho Araneta-Marcos? Paul’s dad is Cacho first cousins with Liza; Paul’s paternal grandma and Liza’s mom are sisters (this makes Paul second cousins with BBM’s kids Sandro, Simon, and Vincent)! Furthermore, BBM and his wife stood as principal sponsors during Paul and Toni’s wedding. This relationship enables Toni to see BBM not one dimensionally, not limited to how he is perceived or judged by others or how he is often presented by the network where she used to work.
Life, people, and issues are very rarely black or white, they are nuanced. There are gradients to our existence. Even when you say that facts are facts, there isn’t just one fact of life—life is made up of countless facts that make a “good versus evil” narrative rather overly simplistic.
And to think these people pride themselves in possessing superior intellect? Is unidimensional, linear thinking (in a multi-dimensional, multifaceted world) a distinctive feature of brilliance? I beg to differ.

14,Robin Padilla to Director Erik Matti: You love to talk about freedom but you don’t respect the freedom of others,"Movie director Erik Matti did not seem please with Toni Gonzaga’s IG post wherein the popular talk show host shared a screengrabbed photo of herself flashing the ‘V’ sign, signifying her support for the BBM-Sara tandem. But the part that made Matti very mad at Toni G was her caption that says, UNBOTHERED.
Toni Gonzaga wrote UNBOTHERED, apparently to send a message to her critics who are calling their fellow Kakampinks to cancel her out.
On Instagram, Erik Matti responded to Toni Gonzaga’s ‘UNBOTHERED’ socmed post, to tell the actress she can support any political candidate whether or not out of affinity, blood or loyalty is between her and her conscience. Matti said Toni can do whatever she want with your celebrity power and God’s guidance because this is a free world, after all. But to be brazen, arrogant and snooty makes all of it despicable, disgusting and really crude.
Erik Matti’s tirade did not escape the radar of senatorial aspirant and the original Bad Boy of the Pinoy movies Robin Padilla who came running to defend Toni Gonzaga from the movie director.
As of this writing, Robin Padilla’s FB post has generated 32,000+ reactions, 5,900 comments and 1,972 shares in just 5 hours and still counting.
You may now read how Robin Padilla gave Erik Matti a good sucker punch to his gut.
