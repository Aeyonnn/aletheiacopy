The proponents from De La Salle University – Dasmarinas, 4th 
year BS in Computer Engineering – Software Engineering Specialization (CPE42) students, would like to ask for your help with their research study. It is called "Aletheia: An Algorithm Benchmarking System for Fake News Detection," and you can spend as much time as you need to decide whether you want to join. If you have any questions or need clarification on any of the terms or concepts in this research study, please do not hesitate to ask questions at any time. 
<br/><br/>
PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH 
<br/><br/>
The aim of the project is to develop an application for a benchmark system using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for fake news detection. The target users would be the internet and social media users. The purpose of the benchmark is to determine which Algorithm will be accurate when trying to detect and predict fake news from the model built from various Datasets including the researchers. 
<br/><br/>
TYPE OF RESEARCH INTERVENTION 
<br/><br/>
To test the functionality and usability of the developed application, the research will involve user testing and evaluation. It will be a set of input relating to any news regardless it be fake or real, and towards the end, a survey and feedback will be given to include the news to the dataset for future testing. 
<br/><br/>
PARTICIPANT SELECTION 
<br/><br/>
Since the nature of the study is a web application, the participants will be internet and social media users. Also, to further provide information to the researcher, data analyst and data engineers will be selected.  
<br/><br/>
VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION 
<br/><br/>
The test will only be conducted with the consent of the participants. Choosing not to participate will have no bearing on job-related evaluations. The participation will only be completely at the discretion of the interviewees. 
<br/><br/>
PROCEDURES 
<br/><br/>
The evaluation or user testing for the developed application will not take more than ten minutes. It can be done at any time by the participant within the testing period given by the researchers. It will involve tasks to be done by the participant relating to the features of the application. The tasks will not be timed and can be completed or not. Afterwards, a feedback form will be given with statements regarding the developed applications and their input for further testing and model training. All of these will not be done in a face-to-face setting due to the limitations set by the pandemic. 
<br/><br/>
DURATION 
<br/><br/>
The time commitments of the research would not require the participants to take a huge amount of their day. The evaluation and testing will not take more than ten minutes, but some follow-up questions may be asked if the need arises in the feedback section. 
<br/><br/>
RISKS 
<br/><br/>
The nature of the tasks and questions of the survey is purely about the developed application and its features. No tasks and questions would involve sensitive and personal issues of the participants. The participation on the evaluation is voluntary. 
<br/><br/>
BENEFITS 
<br/><br/>
The proposed benchmark system will be beneficial to students and professionals who are into language processing. Referencing the study, students and professionals will have an idea of which algorithm they can use or reference when they are creating natural language processing applications. 
<br/><br/>
REIMBURSEMENTS 
<br/><br/>
The participants will not receive compensation or rewards for expenses as their participation is nonmandatory. 
<br/><br/>
CONFIDENTIALITY 
<br/><br/>
The research team will maintain the anonymity of the participants in the evaluation. Specifically, names and other private information of the participants will not be attached to the data.  
<br/><br/>
SHARING THE RESULTS 
<br/><br/>
Participants may request to be notified of the research findings through private e-mail after the conclusion of the study and once a conclusion has been derived from the data gathered. The participants may be notified if the research is to be published online or in print, or if it is to be presented at a conference. 
<br/><br/>
RIGHT TO REFUSE OR WITHDRAW 
<br/><br/>
Participation will be entirely optional, with the ability to withdraw at any time. The results of the evaluation would be erased if the participant wanted to withdraw. The participant has the option of reviewing and revising their remarks at any time. 
<br/><br/>
WHO TO CONTACT 
<br/><br/>
